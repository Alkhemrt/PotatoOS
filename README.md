# PotatoOS by SpudSoft  
A web-based parody of Windows 95/98, reimagined with potato-focused theme. No real potatoes were harmed in the making.

## Features  
- Interactive potato-themed OS.
- Apps like: TaterNet Explorer, Mashed Notepad, SpudDOS Terminal, etc.
- Working Minesweeper.
- Other random websites and apps.
- A ton of easter eggs.

## Disclaimer
(Not an actual OS obviously lol)
